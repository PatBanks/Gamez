This is an application to notify users within a friend group that you wish to play a game, at a time, and has feedback for whether your friends can attend.

Mostly for fun.

Only login authentication has been implemented via Firebase.

If you want to develop the firebase portion of this app, you need
to be added to the firebase project. You then have to copy the 
google-services.json file and put it in your local respository.
